# Iris Data Clustering
## Performed KMeans Clustering on the Iris Data
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
Performed Kmeans Clustering using K values from 1 to 10. Created an Elbow Curve to select appropriate values for choosing values of K.

Performed Clustering with the chosen values and concluded with K=3 as it gave a more detailed clusters.

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
